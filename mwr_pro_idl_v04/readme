This directory contains all information and files necessary for the
automatic re-processing of MWR data on the basis of the HD(CP)2
standards. Additionally, routines create quicklooks
of different MWR level product times series as well as 
cloud radar (MIRA based on mmclx) and ceilometer time series if specified
in the parameter file par_mwr_pro.pro. 

Please follow the steps 1.) - 5.) to get started

1.) Read through and then run file setup_mwr_pro.sh to begin.

2.) Change to the newly created directory mwr_pro/scripts and continue with the file setup_new_meas.sh. 
Think of a three letter code for your measurement setup (mwr_meas) and
modify this script between USER MODIFY begin and USER MODIFY end.
Just run this script once when you are setting up a new measurement/station.

3.) Read through the file par_mwr_pro.pro. This file contains all necessary user-defined settings
for MWR processing. You will need to go through this file in detail to
specify retrievals, modify plot settigs, etc...

4.) Open and read (by eye) the file pl_mk.sh. This is the bash script for running
the IDL scripts of mwr_pro. Adjust parameters defining
processing date and MWR measurement between USER MODIFY begin and USER
MODIFY end passages - once in the beginning, once in the middle of the file.

5.) Run pl_mk.sh and check if data is processed (stored to level1 and level2
netcdf files) and quicklooks are produced. 

Notes:
* Please make sure that pstoimg is installed on your linux.
* Use sort_hatpro_raw_data.sh to sort RPG-format directory structure to
  mwr_pro directory structure, if necessary
* Please store all raw radiometers file of one day in one directory .../yymm/yymmdd to speed up the processing
* If you do not NOT comment the last lines of setup_new_meas.sh then example
data from JÃ¼lich (Sept. 19, 2012) will be copied to your defined data directory and you can directly execute pl_mk.sh 
to see if netcdf files and quicklooks are correctly produced. 
* Retrieval files for some stations that could be suitable for your
measurements may be found in the mwr_pro/retrievals directory.
* The netcdf output files created comply with the HD(CP)2 data product standard
(version 2.0) which may be obtained from www.hdcp2.eu (or andrea.lammert@zmaw.de)
