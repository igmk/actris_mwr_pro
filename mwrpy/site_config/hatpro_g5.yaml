    # offset correction for TBs, i.e. adjustement of observation to nominal frequency:
    # Note: RPG offers a frequency shift within the radiometer software. 
    # This shift will modify the TBs calculated with the RPG software. 
    # Original TBs CANNOT be reconstructed, unless you have recorded the voltages & calibration parameters and possess adequate software routines to perform a re-calibration.
    # Hence, the authors of actris_mwr_pro DO NOT recommend to apply the frequency shifts in general. 
    # If you have applied these frequency shifts, you may still give these to protocol so that they are contained in the resulting level1 netcdf files. 
    # The variable freq_shift specifies the frequency shifts applied [in MHz]. 
    # Set all to 0 if no frequency shifts were applied.
